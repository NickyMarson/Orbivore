# About the Game
A game where you are the Orbivore, an orb that is hungry for other orbs. I created this as a small passion project while wanting to create something with physics while using a simple game engine, in which I settled on Pyxel.  
  
I plan to keep adding stuff when I feel like it an have free time. I have a decent list of ideas so far so I'm not going to run out of things to work on for a while.
