Wanted to make a simple game, investigated pyxel
Started by creating a movable ball, added velocity, acceleration, and friction
Added wall boundaries, made the walls bouncy
Created other non-player balls for the player to eat as a score objective, made balls have variable colors and gravity

Maybe make it 3 modes, 1 is survival where you avoid balls, another you start large and get smaller every hit, last is the current eating game
Magnet to pull balls off screen sometimes pop up

Added a main menu to start the game, view leaderboards, and settings
Added some memory issue prevention by clearing objects when preesing M to go back to the Menu from the Game state

If memory issues were to pop up (very unlikely) then change collision detection formula to have less calculations and add spatial partioning
