Wanted to make a simple game, investigated pyxel
Started by creating a movable ball, added velocity, acceleration, and friction
Added wall boundaries, made the walls bouncy
Created other non-player balls for the player to eat as a score objective, made balls have variable colors and gravity

Maybe make it 3 modes, 1 is survival where you avoid balls, another you start large and get smaller every hit, last is the current eating game
Magnet to pull balls off screen sometimes pop up

Added a main menu to start the game, view leaderboards, and settings
Added some memory issue prevention by clearing objects when preesing M to go back to the Menu from the Game state

If memory issues were to pop up (very unlikely) then change collision detection formula to have less calculations and add spatial partioning

Changed menus to be grid patterns with 2 columns
Added both vertical and horizontal wraparound on the grid
Previous column is remembered in grids with odd numbered options and will move to corresponding row/col correctly based on where it came from
Added balls falling on main menu
Added flow diagram to help keep track of what needs to be completed and show progress

Max memory usage of 41.9 MB and always 30 FPS with spawn cap reached on main menu,
if the memory usage weren't tiny and FPS constantly at 30 then I would be very confused and concerned lol
Implementing settings in game, then going to look into how to save those settings to a file to be read and used on program run
Doing windowed/borderless setting next
